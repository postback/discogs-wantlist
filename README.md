This is a very bare bones app I use to browse through my wantlist. It's my first ever React app, and my first software development since about 15 years. It's very basic, rough around the edges, but does what it needs to do: the wantlist on the discogs site shows sleeves very small, and I sometimes want to browser through my entire wantlist to visually 'memorize' the sleeves, for when I'm digging. This helps me.
